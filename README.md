This was a side project built during my Full Stack Developement program at Lambda School. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally I wanted to build an application that displays a variety of tech puns with CRUD functionality for users to create, update and delete their own tech puns. I started this process by using Node, Express and Knex.js to build the server side of this application.
